# cloud-based-malware-traffic-analysis

Initially designed for my paper project called “SSL/TLS INTERCEPTION FROM THE SHADOW TO THE LIGHT”, this document combines procedures for configuring the key components for malware traffic analysis lab in Amazon EC2.
It describes the methodology to prepare Amazon Image (AMI) for infection phase with and without SSL/TLS interception.
Moreover, this document provides a procedure for testing malware and capturing malicious network traffic.
The main goal of this project is to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
